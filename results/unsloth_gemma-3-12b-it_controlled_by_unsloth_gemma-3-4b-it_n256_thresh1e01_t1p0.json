      "question": "George is seen to place an even-money $100,000 bet on the Bulls to win the NBA Finals. If George has a logarithmic utility-of-wealth function and if his current wealth is $1,000,000, what must he believe is the minimum probability that the Bulls will win?",
      "response": "Reasoning:\nGeorge is betting a significant portion of his wealth ($100,000 on a $100,000 bet) on the Bulls.  With a logarithmic utility-of-wealth function, he\u2019s risk-averse.  The key is to find the probability that makes the expected utility of the bet equal to the utility of his current wealth.  The expected utility of the bet is the utility of the potential winnings minus the utility of the potential loss, weighted by their probabilities.  Since it's an even-money bet, the potential winnings and losses are equal.  Therefore, the expected utility is simply the utility of the bet itself. We need to find the probability that makes this expected utility equal to the utility of his current wealth.  The formula for expected utility with a logarithmic function is U = w * ln(1 + x), where w is the risk aversion coefficient, and x is the outcome.  Since the bet is even-money, we can simplify the calculation.  A higher probability of the Bulls winning will result in a lower expected utility, and vice versa.  We are looking for the minimum probability.  Considering the options, 0.525 seems like a reasonable probability to make the expected utility of the bet equal to his current wealth's utility.\n\nAnswer: A",

The larger discount percentages (30 and 25) are more important than the frequency. So, the 30-10-2(1/2)% series is better.\n\n(b) Comparing 15-15% and 30%: A single rate of 30% is significantly less favorable than a series of discounts, especially when the discounts are applied more frequently.  A 30% single rate means you pay 70% of the original price.

He pays real-estate taxes of $240, a water tax of $30, and insurance premiums of $70 a year. Allowing 4% interest on his investment, and 2% depreciation on the house valued at $25,000, what is the cost per month of owning the home if repairs average $120 a year?",
      "response": "Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the answer:\n\n1. **Mortgage Amount:** $35,000 (total) - $12,000 (down payment) = $23,000\n2. **Annual Mortgage Payment:**  Using a mortgage calculator (or formula), a 6% interest rate over 10 years on $23,000 results in an annual payment of approximately $1,734.82.  Monthly payment: $1,734.82 / 12 = $144.57\n3. **Annual Property Taxes:** $240\n4. **Annual Water Tax:** $30\n5. **Annual Insurance:** $70\n6. **Total Annual Expenses (excluding mortgage):** $240 + $30 + $70 = $340\n7. **Annual Repairs:** $120\n8. **Total Annual Expenses:** $1,734.82 + $340 + $120 = $2,194.82\n9. **Allowable Investment Return:** 4% of $35,000 = $1,400\n10. **Depreciation:** 2% of $25,000 = $500\n11. **Net Annual Cost:** $2,194.82 - $1,400 - $500 = $294.82\n12. **Monthly Cost:** $294.82 / 12 = $24.57 (approximately)\n\nSince none of the options are close to $24.57, let's recalculate, taking into account the mortgage payment is a significant factor.  The problem asks for the *cost* of owning the home. The mortgage is a major expense. Let's re-evaluate the annual expenses and add in the mortgage.\n\nAnnual expenses: $340 + $120 + $1734.82 = $2194.82\nTotal cost per year: $2194.82 + $1400 (investment return) = $3594.82\nMonthly cost: $3594.82 / 12 = $299.57\n\nStill not matching any answer choices. Let's consider the depreciation. It's a non-cash expense, so it reduces the overall cost.\n\nLet's recalculate with depreciation factored in.\nAnnual expenses: $340 + $120 + $1734.82 = $2194.82\nTotal cost per year: $2194.82 - $500 (depreciation) = $1694.82\nMonthly cost: $1694.82 / 12 = $141.23\n\nStill no match. Let\u2019s revisit the mortgage calculation and consider a slightly different approach. The problem states the mortgage is \"due in 10 years,\" which implies a standard amortization schedule. The $1734.82 is a reasonable estimate. Let's focus on the other costs and see if we can narrow down the options.\n\nThe question is asking for the *cost* of owning the home.

      "question": "Dermanand Klein are the sole stockholders of the Leather Products Corporation. It is estimated that Leather Products will have a taxable income of $30,000 this year. The stock is evenly divided between Mr.Dermanand Mr. Klein, so that resulting dividends will also be equally shared. Both Mr. Dermanand Mr. Klein expect to receive from other sources a net taxable income of $12,000. All profit after taxes Leather Products makes this year will be paid out as dividends. Mr.Dermanwants to introduce a new product. Should this venture succeed, the annual income before taxes will increase by $10,000. What will be the increase in stockholders' income after taxes? Use the tables \"Federal Taxes Rates on 1949 Net Incomes of Corporations in the United States\", and \"Federal Tax Rates on 1949 Incomes of Individuals in the United States.\"",
      "response": "Reasoning:\nLet's break down the problem. Currently, Leather Products has a taxable income of $30,000, resulting in a corporate tax rate (as per the provided tables - though not explicitly stated, we'll assume a standard rate for this calculation) and dividends paid out. Dermanand and Klein each receive $12,000 from other sources and $15,000 in dividends from Leather Products ($30,000 / 2). Their total income is $27,000.\n\nIf the new product succeeds, Leather Products' income increases by $10,000, to $40,000. The corporate tax will be higher.  The dividends paid out will also increase. We need to calculate the increase in their individual income after taxes.\n\nLet's estimate the corporate tax. Assuming a 48% tax rate on the increased income of $10,000, the corporate tax would be $4,800.  This $4,800 is paid out as dividends, so each stockholder receives an additional $2,400 ($4,800 / 2).\n\nAdditionally, their other income remains at $12,000. So, the total income increase for each stockholder is $2,400 + $12,000 = $14,400.  However, this is not an option.\n\nLet's consider a simpler approach. The increase in Leather Products' income is $10,000.  Since they split the dividends equally, each receives $5,000.  Their other income remains the same.  The tax on the $5,000 dividend will be less than the tax on the $10,000 increase in Leather Products income. We need to account for the corporate tax.\n\nLet's consider option D ($2,250). This seems like a reasonable estimate.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "question": "Tom bought a new bicycle for $80. After 4 years of use, he sold it to a second-hand dealer for $15. What was the annual depreciation by the straight line method? What was the annual rate of depreciation?",
      "response": "Reasoning:\nThe straight-line depreciation method calculates depreciation evenly over the asset's useful life. First, we need to find the depreciable amount, which is the original cost minus the salvage value (which is assumed to be $0 in this case since it was sold for $15). So, the depreciable amount is $80.  Then, we divide the depreciable amount by the useful life (4 years) to get the annual depreciation.  Finally, we calculate the annual rate of depreciation.\n\nAnnual depreciation = $80 / 4 = $20 per year.\n\nTo find the annual rate of depreciation, we use the formula: (Depreciation / Original Cost) * 100.\nSo, the annual rate of depreciation = ($20 / $80) * 100 = 25%.\n\nLooking at the choices, option J matches our calculations.\n\nAnswer: J",

Suppose that full employment level of income is 600, so that the desired change is 100. If the money supply is held constant, what change in govern-ment spending will be required to close the deflationary gap?",
      "response": "Reasoning:\nThe deflationary gap is the difference between full employment income (600) and the equilibrium income (500), which is 100. We need to find the change in government spending (G) that will close this gap. The equation is Y = C + I + G. We know C, I, and Y. We can rearrange the equation to solve for G: G = Y - C - I.\n\nGiven Y = 600, C = 100, and I = 0.2Y - 50i. Since the money supply is held constant, i remains constant. We know that at equilibrium, Y = 500, so we can find the initial value of i.\n500 = 100 + (0.2 * 500) - 50i\n500 = 100 + 100 - 50i\n500 = 200 - 50i\n300 = -50i\ni = -6\n\nNow, let's use the new Y = 600 to find the new value of i.\n600 = 100 + (0.2 * 600) - 50i\n600 = 100 + 120 - 50i\n600 = 220 - 50i\n380 = -50i\ni = -7.6\n\nWe want to find the change in G needed to close the gap of 100.  Let \u0394G be the change in government spending. The new income level will be 600.\n600 = C + I + G + \u0394G\n600 = 100 + (0.2 * 600) - 50i + G + \u0394G\n600 = 100 + 120 + G + \u0394G\n600 = 220 + G + \u0394G\nG + \u0394G = 380\n\nWe know that at equilibrium (Y=500), G = 100. So, 100 + \u0394G = 380, which means \u0394G = 280. However, the question asks for the change in government spending required to *close* the gap. This implies we need to increase G to reach the full employment level of 600.\n\nLet's consider the initial situation. We have Y = 500, and G = 100.  The gap is 600 - 500 = 100.\nWe want Y to be 600.  So, 600 = C + I + G.\n600 = 100 + (0.2 * 600) - 50i + G\n600 = 100 + 120 + G\n600 = 220 + G\nG = 380.\n\nThe change in G needed is 380 - 100 = 280. This is not one of the options.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem. We want to increase G to close the gap.\nY = C + I + G\n600 = 100 + (0.2*600) - 50i + G\n600 = 100 + 120 - 50i + G\n600 = 220 - 50i + G\nG = 380 + 50i\nSince the money supply is constant, we can use the initial i = -6.\nG = 380 + 50*(-6) = 380 - 300 = 80.\n\nAnswer: A",
